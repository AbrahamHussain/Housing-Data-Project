# Housing-Data-Project

This was a pet project where I analyzed the housing market in the San Franscisco bay area. I used a dataset
from kaggle.com that gave me the parameters of (proximity to water, median age, average income, number of bedrooms
number of bathrooms, number of resident).

The project can be broken into two steps: data processing and running traning algorithms. The data processing took 
a lot of time since it took a significant amount of time to see which parameters really mattered. Most of the work 
was done through testing. Next I ran a regression to predict the value using scikit-learn. I sped up the process 
by using a grid search method of finding the best parameter values.
